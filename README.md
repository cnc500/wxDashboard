  ## Description 
  The user is presented a dashboard that allows the input of a city, and then select the location of that city from various locations in the open weather map database.  For example, there are other cities named Austin besides the one in Texas, and the user can select which Austin they are looking for.  Once a valid city in the Open Weather Map database is selected by the user, the user is presented current weather conditions as well as a 5 day forecast.  The user's last 12 city choices are saved as clickable buttons so that the user may select those cities sometime in the future, including after restarting the program since they are saved in the user's local storage.  Once the user selects a 13th city, that city is saved but the oldest city that the user had selected is deleted from local storage and as being a button option for the user to select.

  ## Usage
  Weather Dashboard is a great way to keep track of the weather at your favorite locations.  It also notifies the user of the current UV index for the city selected with a color code indicating favorable (green), moderate (yellow) or severe (red).
